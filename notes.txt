-------------Synchronous communication and Async Communication: --------

--> Synchronous communication:
        * one service depends on other service response
        * To make Http request use 'WebClient'
--> Asynchronous communication:
        * one response not depends on other service response
        * it doesn't care about other service response

    Eg:-

                        Http Request
     1. Order Service ---------------> Inventory service (checking stock is available or not)
                      <---------------
                         Response

         * Here order service waiting for inventory response , (Sync Communication)
         * If does not care about inventory service means (Async Communication)
